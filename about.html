        <h2> About me</h2>
        <p> I have always had an interest in computers since I was a kid. I enjoyed browsing the internet, playing
            games, and watching Youtube.
            I attended the University of Southern Indiana. During my time there I went for Business Administration as I
            was not sure what exactly I wanted
            to do. Once the pandemic hit I decided to leave and move back home. After getting through Covid-19 I was
            able to get a sense of what I'd like to do
            for my career. </p>
